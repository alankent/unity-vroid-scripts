# unity-vroid-scripts

* CopyBlendShapes.cs - Simple code showing how to read and write blend shape definitions (does a verbatim copy).
* CleveryBlendCopier.cs - Experimental Unity C# script to copy blend shapes from one VRoid characte Face to another, even if the meshes have been modified. (It does some expressions okay, but fails around the mouth.)
