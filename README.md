# unity-vroid-scripts

* CopyBlendShapes.cs - Simple code showing how to read and write blend shape definitions (does a verbatim copy).
* CleveryBlendCopier.cs - Experimental Unity C# script to copy blend shapes from one VRoid characte Face to another, even if the meshes have been modified. (It does some expressions okay, but fails around the mouth.) See also [this blog](https://extra-ordinary.tv/2020/09/07/copying-blendshapes-in-unity-with-a-script/)
* AddIFacialMocapBlendShapes.cs - Experimental Unity C# script to generate blend shapes needed by ARKit (and ifacialmocap.com) from the default blend shapes from VRoid Studio (no use of Blender or other tools is required). Takes 5 to 10 minutes to run.
